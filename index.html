<p>Dreamcatcher is a dream journal for WebOS. Although I've been told that the majority of the people use it as a password protected journal or note taking application. It's currently one of the top-rated free applications in the Palm App Catalog.</p>

<p>This beta app is baked with search and a kick-ass indexing system which will make nice things come in the future like really sweet graphs with all kinds of stats (I like stats)</p>

<p>Any suggestions, feedback, support or complaints should be directed to my twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/goatslacker">@goatslacker</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/goatslacker/Dreamcatcher">Dreamcatcher</a> for WebOS uses <a href="https://github.com/goatslacker/Snake">Snake</a>, both are open source and available on github</p>

<h4>Note: I promise to make this page more appealing soon enough</h4>
