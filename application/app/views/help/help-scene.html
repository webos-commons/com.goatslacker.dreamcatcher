      <div class="palm-body-text">
        I'd have yet to find a suitable third-party service that offers precise
        and reliable dream interpretation without annoying you with advertisements.

        <br /><br />

        Due to that fact I've chosen not to include any dream interpretation and perhaps
        offer my own somewhere down the line.

        <br /><br />

        If you're really curious to know what your dreams mean I recommend
        you to pickup a book at your local library on the subject.
